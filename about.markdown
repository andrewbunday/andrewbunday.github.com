### A technologist with an interest in the sharing of complex data and visual effects workflows
---

As a Pipeline Supervisor my role is to develop and maintain the vision of, and required technology that make up the company's pipeline. Requirements are derived by balancing the demands of both projects in production and the long term goals of the company.

The industry wide struggle which companies are experiencing, who may be either large or small, to handle ever diminishing returns on investment of any bespoke/in-house technology is set to be a key area of research and development in the coming years. Additionally the development of cloud computing resources and an ever more mobile workforce are on the verge of creating exciting new ways of working. Ways of working which could completely change the way we think.

I'm now looking forward to finding opportunities to investigate and help develop these new areas.
