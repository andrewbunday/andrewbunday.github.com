### I'm a Technologist living in London where I supervise the VFX Pipeline for Baseblack

My role as a pipeline supervisor requires that I develop and maintain the vision and technology that make up the company's pipeline. This is based on requirements placed upon it by the demands of current and future production and the company's long term goals.

I post to a variety of sites, including:

#### [Recent Activity]()

Over the last 1.5 years I've been working with the team at [Shotgun Software](http://shotgunsoftware.com) on their solution to asset management called [Tank](http://shotgunsoftware.com/tank). My involvement has included providing feedback, suggestions on direction and testing of tank in the real world.

I make lots of Quicktimes. With pretty much every app going. One of my favourites has been [Tweak Software's RV](http://tweaksoftware.com). 

Recently we've started a collaboration with [Zync Render](http://www.zyncrender.com/) to try and help continue the development of their cloud rendering solution to meet the needs of a studio like ours.

#### [Past History]()

Prior to Baseblack I was an engineer at the BBC's Research and Development department where I worked on the [YouView](http://youview.com) project, specialising on a audience measurement platform for the system. 

I began in VFX with the [Moving Picture Company](http://moving-picture.com) in London. Over the course of several years I moved between roles until I helped to build a team with rendering expertise as part of the Production Engineering group.

#### [Everything Else]()

* I like spending time riding my motorcycle on the roads around London or when the time provides and weather doesn't preclude, on the winding roads of Wales.

* I like to scuba dive, although haven't had much time over the past year or so, which is making my drysuit feel neglected.

* I like learning new tools, such as Jekyll which resulted in the port of this site from my own Wordpress server to a Github pages hosted solution.

* I like spending time outside running, jumping and throwing myself into the ground.
