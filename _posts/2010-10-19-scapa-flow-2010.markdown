At the beginning of September myself and a bunch of guys and gals from my dive
club [**Ariel Divers**](http://www.arieldivers.org/) and another BSAC affiliate
[**Bermondsey**](http://www.bermondsey-bsac.org.uk) headed up to the far
northern tip of Scotland to spend a week on the Orkney Islands diving the famous
Scapa Flow wrecks.

The diving was harder than anything I've ever experienced before but within my
limits and I definitely enjoyed myself during the trip. Both for the diving and
relaxing in a part of the country that truly is spectacular, we really are lucky
to live in this beautiful country.

Check out the photos in the main post.
