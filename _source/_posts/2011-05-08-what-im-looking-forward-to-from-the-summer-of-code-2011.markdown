title: "What Im looking forward to from the Summer of Code 2011"

It's that time of year again when CS majors have finished their course work,
polished off more than a few late nights revising for their finals, and finally
are able to start working on their Summer of Code projects.

For anyone unsure of what SoC is, here is a short description:

> Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers students stipends to
> write code for open source projects. We have worked with the open source
> community to identify and fund exciting projects for the upcoming summer.

I always find it interesting to take a quick peek through the project lists at this
time of year to see which organisations signed themselves up, and what projects
are going to be worked on over the summer break. The full list can be found
[**here**](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2011)
for anyone wanted to look themselves.

This year there are a few oss projects which are having effort expended on them
which may turn out to be useful. My particular favourite is probably to try and
create a [**Photoshop PSD plugin**](http://www.google-
melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/oiio) for OpenImageIO. If it's successful
it will provide fantastic functionality to access psd's to any application which
makes use of the OIIO shared library, without having to make any substantial
changes to your own code. Or using the python binding to OIIO you could hook
together simple processes such as a colour space conversion on a PSD file,
passing the output into a renderer compliant mip-mapped texture file.

Reaching the end of my look through the list I was a little disappointed not to
see any of the larger broadcasters or vfx facilities contributing directly to
the organisation/mentor lists. Whilst I know that many of them do already
provide their own mentor-ship and intern programmes don't you think that it
would be good if they engaged in this public forum too? Or even, and this I
would love to have happen, for the tech communities to gather together and share
our collective knowledge towards a _greater good_.
