title: Making Windows Usable
---

We all have our pet hates. Mine includes complaining about the crappy the user
interfaces provided as default by operating systems.

Another pet hate of mine is people who complain about something without trying
to do something about it. Which is why when I find a system I'm using is playing
silly buggers with me I set off trying to find ways to work around the issues I
have until I have something that I don't mind using.

To that end over the last 2 years that I've had to use Windows XP daily _(yes I
know that it's an old system and many corporate IT departments are now switching
over to Win7, but I have to use it so I'm going to post it) _ I've made a few
changes and installed a few apps which have helped me keep productive.

So, onwards with my setup for Windows.

### Putty

    A simple multiple-protocol terminal client.

### Launchy

    Used Quicksilver or Spotlight? Well its a cheesy copy of one of those. For
    me the simple type based calculator is a lifesaver.

### Xming

    A fantastic light X11 framebuffer for Win32. Excellent for connecting to
    graphic-less set top box emulators.

### Dropbox

    www.dropbox.com my install everywhere file sync solution. If you have less
    than 2GB to store the service is free :)

###KeePassX

    Tired of remembering those crazy CAPITAL,number,lowercase passwords that
    services require these days to be changed every few weeks? Well I don't. For
    lower security services I store randomly generated passwords in a keylock
    file allowing me to only remember the master password.

### VirtualBox/VMware Player

    Whichever of these you choose you'll end up with the same end result. Easy to
    setup instances of any machine you need. A godsend when you need a clean
    environment.

And these are non-essential but useful applications which I use most days:

### Foxit Reader

    OMG this is what Adobe Reader should be like. Multiple documents opened in
    new tabs, fast and responsive. No freaking updates every few days which are
    'critical'.

### Chrome Browser

    Fastest, cleanest web browser out there today. That it syncs my bookmarks
    between machines is an added bonus. I run the dev channel releases which
    means getting new features early, but also means running foul of bugs from
    time to time.

### Wallpaper Changer

    In my last post I described the process for having a cycling wallpaper in
    Ubuntu 10.10. This app does the same thing in WinXP. Thankfully Win7 has the
    feature baked in.

### Picasa Photo viewer

    Whilst I don't use Picasa web hosting for my photos this is defiantly the
    nicest image viewer for WinXP.
