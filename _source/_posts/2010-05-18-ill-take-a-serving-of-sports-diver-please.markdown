title: I'll take a serving of... Sports Diver please.
---

This weekend saw a group of hardy Ariel divers take to the chilly waters of
Stoney Cove to complete training for both Sports Divers and Dive Leaders.

Personally I had still to complete a dive whilst using an SMB and to plan and
lead a dive, reviewing existing skills such as an AS lift, mask clearing and
buoyancy check.

Thankfully my two training dives  went off without a hitch on the Saturday,
which along with assisting in the dive managing for the weekend left me as a
brand new Sports Diver.

Sunday ended up being far more relaxed as I played at being a body in the
morning and being led by another trainee in the afternoon.

It was brisk in the water at a steady 6/7 Celsius, but it was fun and thankfully
sunny.
