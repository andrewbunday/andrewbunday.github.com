This past week I’ve been to Lundy and back, dived with seals, run up and down the cliffs and gone in search of Puffins.

Last Thursday I set off for Lundy with a group of friends from my dive club, Ariel Divers. Unfortunately Steve, who was also my ride down to Devon became sick on the Wednesday night and had to go to hospital leaving me to hitch a ride with the others in the club truck.

We set off sometime after 4pm and after a long drive arrived in Clovelly, a bizarre historic fishing town on the coast. After bunking down for the night in the local B&B we set off in the morning to meet our skipper and sail over to the island.

This is Clive, who’s boat the Jessica Hettie we dived off of for the 4 days we were on the island for.

Whilst there, we dived with seals, and took in a couple of wrecks. We spend time in the local (only) pub and went on a late night search for deer we’d been told were near. We did manage to find the deer thankfully although when we did then realised that we’d actually just walked past most of the rest of the herd in the dark.

On the last evening before we left I decided to go for a wander off across the island in search of Puffins and pretty views. I was rewarded well as the sun slowly set I was able to capture a set of beautiful views.
