                            <p><p>A couple of weeks ago whilst browsing around the Kindle store documentation
looking up using the platform as a publishing service I came across the Kindle
Developer pages and remembered having seen them been launched a few months
earlier.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;d originally taken a glance at the pages I didn&#8217;t have any ideas of what
I could create for the Kindle, especially in light of having not had one at the
time. Since then I bought one of the newest ones, receiving mine on release day
was a fantastic feeling (especially when my iPad co-joined flatmate started
eyeing it up).</p>

<p>In the few months since I&#8217;ve gotten more and more used to simply having it on me
all the time. It&#8217;s light enough and just small enough to carry pretty much
everywhere, either in my backpack or one of the large roomy pockets I have on my
coat.</p>

<p>Now this isn&#8217;t a Kindle review, nor is it a love-fest posting about the device.
I simply want to give some context. You see I now used this thing pretty much
every day which has meant that my mind can occasionally think up little ideas
for things I would like to be able to do with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a handy tip, I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;ll fit quite happily inside a medium zip-
lock bag making it quite waterproof for reading whilst on a windswept boat, by
the beach or even in the bath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My idea for an App I&#8217;d like to make came from one of these times when I had my
Kindle in its waterproof bag whilst scuba diving up in Scotland. My hands were
damp, along with pretty much everything on the boat so taking a book was a no-
go. But I was able to read away without any problems.</p>

<p>Something however that I wasn&#8217;t able to do so easily was record my dives in my
log book.</p>

<p>Previously I&#8217;ve switched from having a hand written book to recording all of my
dives in a digital dive log application on my lap top and mobile phone. Of
course taking either of those devices out on the open water is a stupid thing to
do, so I wasn&#8217;t able to record my dives until late each day when we got back to
port.</p>

<p>But what if my Kindle had an App which could record that data for me? I know
that it&#8217;s probably going to be safe in its pouch, and if it had some data sync
capability I wouldn&#8217;t need to worry overtly if it were to be water damaged as
the data would be safe and the device itself is fairly cheap.</p>

<p>So please, if anyone from Amazon with the power to approve my application to
join the KDK were to read this post, please help me out and add me to the
program.</p>

<p>Oh and here is a video of some of us jumping in the water on that dive trip
