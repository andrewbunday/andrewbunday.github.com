                            <p><p>I&#8217;ve been a user for around 8 years now. It started out during the summer before
my 2nd year of Uni. My Dad gave me a 2nd gen iPod, with a stonking 10GB of
space.</p>

<p>At the time I didn&#8217;t have 10GB of music stored as mp3s and our PC at home didn&#8217;t
even have a HDD that large. Windows didn&#8217;t have iTunes so Apple supplied a
plugin for a peice of craptacular software to handle syncing and that had to be
done over a firewire connection.</p>

<p>Since those easly days I&#8217;ve worked my way through 3 i-devices, my iPod(2nd gen),
a iPod nano and an iPhone 3Gs. I even strayed away for a short time with another
mp3 player whilst travelling for a few months.</p>

<p>The plugin was replaced with iTunes on Windows and firewire was replaced with
good ol&#8217; USB 2.0. Battery life improved and each player got smaller, lighter and
more powerful, capable of handling a multitude of tasks.</p>

<p>But through all this time one accessory has failed to be improved. Those damn
stupid stock earbuds.</p>

<p>Lets take a quick look at this image, on the left are a pair of early buds, on
the right some of the current ones you&#8217;ll get if you buy a new iPod. Their
aesthetic has been changed, removing the harsh duplo styling of the originals
and replacing it with a smoother softer look in keeping with the design of other
Apple products. They&#8217;ve also picked up a slightly rubberier edge to the bud so
that it no longer scratches quite as much as they previously did.</p>

<p>And yet that&#8217;s about all they&#8217;ve done.</p>

<p>Over the 9 years since the original iPod was introduced we&#8217;ve now got touch
screens on all but the very smallest of the players. Battery lives through the
roof, <em>somewhat</em> improved sound quality and string of other improvements.
Apple&#8217;s design is sometimes called evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Yet
in the case of their headphones its practically stagnant.</p>

<p>So we all carry on doing what we&#8217;ve had to do for all these long years and carry
on buying our own extra headphones on the side.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this whilst wearing a pair of HD380 pro&#8217;s. Slightly ott, but you get
the point.</em></p>
